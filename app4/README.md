#PROJECT4
In this project I developped a website where I used "webscraping" tools to load statistical data related in relation to E-Commerce<br>
thanks to yahoo finance API and BeautifulSoup packages<br>
The website application is easy to interact with ,comprehensable for new clients and visually appealing.<br>

I used Flask rendering tools to plot Netflix closing price over time.
