Use<br>
"pip install streamlit" in terminal to install streamlit tools<br>
then use<br>
"streamlit run project3.py"<br>
Remember to access to project folder before running the app. using "cd" command.<br>
This web application developed using python showcases my skills in data analysis and knowledge in Machine Learning models;<br>
ML models used in this projects: <br>
1-SVM: Support Vector Machines<br>
2-LR: Linear Regression<br>
3-RF: Random Forest<br>
bonus: I added a PCA Principal Components Analysis with plotting too<br>
With this App You will be able to choose of these classifiers. You can also adjust (hyper)parameters and observe accuracy results.<br>
Finally it provides up to three metrics plotting:<br>
*Confusion Matrix<br>
*ROC (AUC) curve<br>
*Precision recall curve<br>
