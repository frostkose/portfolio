This web application developed using python showcases my skills in data analysis and knowledge in Machine Learning models;
ML models used in this projects: 
1-SVM: Support Vector Machines
2-LR: Linear Regression
3-RF: Random Forest
bonus: I added a PCA Principal Components Analysis with plotting too
With this App You will be able to choose of these classifiers. You can also adjust (hyper)parameters and observe accuracy results.
Finally it provides up to three metrics plotting:
*Confusion Matrix
*ROC (AUC) curve
*Precision recall curve
