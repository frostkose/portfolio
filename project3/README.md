Colon cancer is a significant health concern worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project explores the potential of machine learning to aid in the early identification of colon cancer using patient data and advanced algorithms.<br>
 By employing machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and SVM, I aim to effectively classify patients using a minimal set of features. <br>
 My primary objective is to optimize the modelâ€™s performance while reducing computational costs, ultimately creating a more efficient and practical tool for early disease detection. <br>
"pip install streamlit" in terminal to install streamlit tools<br>
then use<br>
"streamlit run project3.py"<br>
Remember to access the project folder before running the app using "cd" command.<br>
This web application developed using python showcases my skills in data analysis and knowledge in Machine Learning models;<br>
ML models used in this projects: <br>
1-SVM: Support Vector Machines<br>
2-LR: Linear Regression<br>
3-RF: Random Forest<br>
bonus: I added a PCA Principal Components Analysis with plotting too<br>
With this App You will be able to choose one of these classifiers. You can also adjust (hyper)parameters and observe accuracy results.<br>
Finally it provides up to three metrics plotting:<br>
*Confusion Matrix<br>
*ROC (AUC) curve<br>
*Precision recall curve<br>
THANK YOU
GOOD LUCK
